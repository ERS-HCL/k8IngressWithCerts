## k8IngressWithCerts
W have seen in our Devops meetup, we had discussion on using certificates in Kubernetes Application.So,I will start this journey of explaining how we can use certificate for our kubernetes application.First Topic,I would be doing is using certificates in our Kubernetes enviornment for local setup... 

Pl. see the <i> selfsignedCertWithIngress </i> for documentation and its usage.

Once done, we would grow our learning and see how we can do in real world later..
